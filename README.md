# SDTLConverter
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ThomasThelen/sdtl-converter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ThomasThelen/sdtl-converter)

A python script for turning SDTL in JSON-LD into ProvONE/Prov.

### Status

Things seems to work fine with commands that aren't using data from
other commands. Support for commands that use other data is under
development. I recently did a refactor and pulled the retrospective
provenance out, but will re-add it once I get data usage working (to
reduce complexity).

### Try it Out

The following examples are currently working.

`single_command`

`two_commads`

`three_commands`

`load_command`
